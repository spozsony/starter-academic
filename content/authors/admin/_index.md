Sofia Pozsonyiova recently graduated from Macalester College with a BA in Applied Mathematics and Statistics with a focus in Community and Global Health. Sofia is now a member of Mayo Clinicâ€™s Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics serving as a Statistical Program Analyst where she specializes in Computational Genomics and aids the Genetics of Addiction Lab with their on-going Alcohol Use Disorder Study. 

An overarching goal of her research is to optimize and improve the patient experience by using statistical methodology to help improve the overall detection and diagnosis process.  When Sofia is not thinking about statistics, you can find her rock climbing, backpacking, or cooking up a storm in the kitchen!
